About
-----

fed was started as a simple replacement text editor for the quite popular
editor nano.  The project's founder worked with nano for years, but got sick
of poor syntax highlighting, and the lack of familiar editor commands.  He
used pico, before nano, and since nano hasn't changed much recently, he
decided to write his own.

Though "fed" is a text editor, it can also handle binary files.

fed is released under the New BSD License.  Stay fed!


Upgrading the Packaged Verson of GeSHi
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Quite simply, you can probably just replace the folder geshi that is packaged
with fed before building and installing it.  We see no reason for this to 
change, unless GeSHi changes extensively, which it won't.


Known Issues
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So far we have only tested this editor via Tera Term and PuTTy on Ubuntu.

If you have experienced an issue and wish to report it,
please do so on the project page: http://sourceforge.net/projects/fed/

We may not be able to fix your problem if we do not have a similar setup.
Please report bugs to our project page and include all relevant information
in a complete and understandible way.

After the first beta version of this tool, new releases will still occur, but
we are looking for a "caretaker" of this project.  We also encourage you to
submit changes, patches, updates, fixes and plug-ins.

To increase performance by bypassing disk operations, you may keep GeSHi in
memory by copying GeSHi to a tmpfs or other ramdisk and then tell fed where
this new copy of GeSHi is with the +geshi=/file/path directive.


fed's Features
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Binary and Text

While primarily a text editor, fed can also read binary files and you can
edit the octal values of the individual bytes.  fed will try to detect
the appropriate encoding type or you can force it with a command line
directive (See "Command Line Options" for more)

Syntax Highlighting

Using the tasty GeSHi plug-in for PHP, fed uses GeSHi to display your file
properly highlighted on the screen.  This feature can be suppressed with
the command line option -geshi and you can change the highlighting or
disable it inside the editor

Multi-tabbed View

Load multiple files into the editor and switch between them.  If only one
file is loaded into fed, tabs are suppressed.

Deletion Buffer versus ClipBoard

A deletion buffer is not a clipboard, but a separate series of lines deleted
using the Kut (not Cut) command, similar to nano.  A clipboard is a place where
the common PC commands "Cut, Paste, Copy" are used to manipulate selected areas.
The editor fed also supports the "grid selection" which is helpful for
programming and using fed to edit columnar data.

Context Menu and Plug-ins

The context menu lets you pick a plug-in (written in PHP) to execute on a
selection, or the current word. See the "Plug-ins" section for more
information on this feature.


.fed Configuration
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A .fed file in your home directory may contain the following line at the top
of the file:

fed <default command line>
^^^
optional

A .fed file in your home directory may include a number of paths to .php files
after the above line, which point to plug-ins you wish to have installed into
the context menu upon execution.

The root admin may place a .fed file at the location /etc/fed/.fed which is
readable by everyone, however a .fed in the user's home directory will append
any plug-ins and override the root's command line default.  If such a file
does not exist, fed will load with shipped plug-ins and the compiled default
configuration.

See the section "command line options" below for what you can configure.


Interface
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- fed uses two sets of bindings to identical commands
- the first set is the "intended", and the second identical command set is
  called "fallback"
- it is intended to be easy to use, visually interesting and minimal

"Intended" Commands:

The intended command set may not work properly on all machines and terminals.
However, it is the ideal set of commands and the preferred editing set.
Commands are case-insensitive except for [,] and {,}

Ctrl-O  : Show the undo historical timeline
Ctrl-Y  : Redo

Ctrl-L  : Load...
Ctrl-S  : Save
Ctrl-Q  : Close (and prompt to save)
Ctrl-\  : Emergency Exit (without saving)
Ctrl-I  : Insert file at cursor
Ctrl-E  : Export a copy as... (note: creates a new tab!)
Ctrl-N  : New file
Ctrl-=  : Toggle "End of Line" mode (CR or CRLF)

Ctrl-F  : Find
Ctrl-R  : Find and Replace
Ctrl-'  : Find all occurances (similar to "Find all" in other editors)
Ctrl-G  : Goto line #

Ctrl-K  : Kut this line and append it to the deletion buffer (not clipboard)

Ctrl-V  : Paste selection from clipboard

Ctrl--  : "Ctrl-Minus" Go back one file tab (for multitabbed)
Ctrl-=  : "Ctrl-Equals" Go forward one file tab (for multitabbed)

Delete  : Delete selection (while selecting), or Backspace/Del
Insert  : Toggle insert mode
Page Key: Move up or down by one screen length
Arrows  : Move the cursor
Ctrl-,  : (Ctrl-Comma) "Free move" mode (moves beyond EOL)

  Note: You should activate "Ansi Control Codes" in your term, though fed will
        try to use VT100 codes as a fallback if available.
        -See appendix "VT100 Cursors"

Ctrl-H  : Help (x to exit, PageUp/PageDown, Arrows)
Ctrl-8  : Configure/disable GeSHi
Ctrl-J  : Justify this line
Ctrl-T  : Tab
Ctrl-M  : Mops up spaces at the ends of the lines selected, or all
Ctrl-B  : Beautify this code (experimental, similar to Proce55ing)
Ctrl-/  : "Ctrl-/" - activate context menu*
Ctrl-_  : "Ctrl-Space" (not Ctrl-underscore) - activate context menu*
Ctrl-;  : Brings up the commmand prompt
Ctrl-1  : Load a plug-in from a file
Ctrl-0  : "Ctrl-zero" brings up the octal inserter
Enter   : When in binary mode, enter lets you modify an octal value

* - see "plug-ins" section

Command Line Options
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Usage: fed [options] [filename(s)...]

Where 'options' is one or more of:

--help         Displays this
-h             Displays this
-help          Suppresses the bottom line helper cheat sheet
+fallback      Turns on "fallback" mode
-ruler         Suppresses the column ruler
+clock         Sticks a clock in the ruler, or if -ruler then lower right
-geshi         Disables syntax highlighting
+geshi=/path   Tells fed which copy of GeSHi to use
-plugins       Loads no plugins except GeSHi
-fed           Ignores .fed configuration files (both root and home)
-root          Ignores root .fed if it exists
+free          fed starts with "Free Move" mode on
+binary        Forces all files to be read in as binary (cannot turn off)
+fedhome=path  Sets the path to fed's home (/usr/bin and /etc/fed as default)
-clearscreen   Forces fed to render without clear screen code!  ugh
+tabs=5        Number of spaces that mimic a \t (5 is default)
+invert        Forces fed to render white background and black text
-invert        Forces fed to render black backround and white text (default)
-color         fed will not use color codes
-1             Forces status bar mode 1 (default, unless root overridden)
-2             Forces status bar mode 2

And 'filename(s)' is one or more:

<filename>     Loads the filename into a "tab"
b+<filename>   Forces binary on a file
a+<filename>   Forces ascii on a file
u+<filename>   Forces UTF (WIP!)

*** Loads filename, and renames it to target (saves when you tell it to):
(b,a,u+)<"/path/to/filename">^(b,a,u+)<"path/to/target">

Examples:

fed somefile.txt
fed a+somefile.tar.gz
fed /some/file/1.txt /some/file/2.txt b+/some/other/file.bin
fed /some/file/named.txt^/some/file/renamed.txt
fed b+/some/file/somewhere.txt^a+/some/file/elsewhere.txt
fed "somefile.txt"
fed b+"/some/other/file.txt"
fed
fed b+

The final example in the list above creates a new binary file for editing.
The one above that one (fed alone) creates a new ascii file for editing,
and is the same as "fed a+"

Note: if you need to create or edit a file called b+, type fed "b+"


Editor Layout
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This section may look a little weird, but the goal is to show you what it will
look like to be using fed:

Example default screen 80x6:

0...5....A....E...|20...,....|30..,....|....,....|....,....|60..,..70|.........V
[<yourfilename>][ anotherfile ][ fi... ] [ etc.. ] [ tab5 ]
your text file
[: 
Line 123/783921             Col 44       [somefile.name]    BINARY     Modified 
Ctrl+ H:elp [,]:Sel X:Cut C:opy V:Paste F:ind Z:un O:log Y:re L:oad S:ave Q:uit

Above: A Column Ruler appears at the top of the view, and a Status Readout appears
at the bottom.  The current file you are editing appears in the Status Readout
(see below).  There is also the command prompt (lower left) and the cheat sheet
(bottom line).

Legend:

 - Column Ruler (top)

0...5....A....E...|20...,....|30..,....|....,....|....,....|60..,..70|.........V

Can be suppressed with the command line option -ruler

With the command line option +clock you may see this one:

0...5....A....E...|20...,....|30..,....|....,....|..12:52a.|60..,..70|.........V

 - Command Entry Prompt

[: 

Allows you to type commands and have the editor respond in "Fallback" mode and 
some other modes. This prompt appears and disappears in "Intended" mode.

 - Status Readout (bottom)

Status readouts come in 2 modes:

-First mode (option -1, default):
Line 123/7821 Col 44 [/some/full/path/file.name] Selecting   BINARY  Modified 

-Second mode (option -2):
L 123/7831:44/80 [somefile.name] INS BIN Mod [#oct] Saved

First we see the file line and then the column of the current position, followed
by the filename in brackets.

If you loaded fed without -help the following line appears below the status bar:

Ctrl+ H:elp [,]:Sel X:Cut C:opy V:Paste F:ind Z:un O:log Y:re L:oad S:ave Q:uit

Or the Fallback cheat sheet, if -help is not used and +fallback is used:

?:H:elp [,]:Sel X:Cut C:opy V:Paste F:ind Z:un O:log Y:re L:oad S:ave Q:uit



Plug-ins
------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Overview

Plug-ins come in two flavors: vetted and non-vetted.  A vetted plug-in is
included with the distribution, while a non-vetted plug-in is one you've
installed yourself, from some source, that hasn't been vetted.

To have your plug-ins vetted, they must be submitted under the same license
(New BSD) as fed, and they also must be posted or otherwise sent to the fed
developers.  Plug-ins will be vetted when they are not malicious, explain
themselves thoroughly and precisely, and if they are unique or useful.

Vetted plug-ins that ship with fed:

 - ispell checker (works only if you have ispell installed)
 - figlet generation
 - htmltidy (works only if you have libtidy+deps installed to php5)
 - xmltidy (works only if you have libtidy+deps installed to php5)

Installation

Users may install fed plug-ins by including them in their .fed configuration
file, as mentioned above in the section ".fed configuration"

Authoring Plug-ins

Helper code is found in the authors/ folder of the package.

To author a plug-in, simply write a PHP file, with the following special
circumstances:

1) fed will supply a variable $INCOMING inserted after the leading ?php tag
   this variable contains an array:

    $INCOMING['base64encoded']    selected data
    $INCOMING['row']              cursor position
    $INCOMING['col']              cursor position
    $INCOMING['binary']           (true===binary)

   Vetted plug-ins will make proper use of this information.
    
2) fed will expect your plug-in to output results in the following format:

<base64 encoded: output to console>--fedboundary--<base64 encoded: data in a list>--fedboundary--<base64 encoded: data in a list>

"output to console" section

The "output to console" section is output, formatted with the "plug-in
special code", that provides feedback to a user and options.  If "output
to console" section is empty (ie if the output from the php file starts
with --fedboundary--), no user selection is provided and the
"data in a list" sections are immediately inserted without prompt.  
Insertion will overwrite a selection if a selection is being made.

"data in a list" section

The "data in a list" section is a series of bounded base64 encoded data
segments which correspond to options presented in the "output to console"
section, where each subsequent entry is numbered consecutively starting
from 0.  Each "data in a list" section can be bound using "plug-in special
code" in the "output to console" section of the output from the PHP plug-in.

"plug-in special code"

Plug-in special code is the ASCII text contained in the base64 encoded
section "output to console"; this code is used to bind results of a PHP
plug-in operation to a formatted menu, so the user may decide what to do
before committing the result.  In the event that your plug-in wishes to
have a "do nothing" option, simply bind a result to a non-existant list
item, such as -1.

Each line of the "output to console" section must contain the following,
otherwise no user options are presented and every returned data element
will be used consecutively:

<option name>:<single key-stroke or "ESC">:<list element index>

Example 1, "output to console" section: Two options

Option One:1:0
Option Two:2:1

Example 2, "output to console" section: Made-up output from a PHP plug-in

Translate into (L)atin:L:0
Translate into (F)rench:F:1
Translate into (E)nglish:E:2
(X) Leave it alone:ESC,X:-1

Example 2, "data in a list" section, split by --fedboundary-- and decoded base64:

Ecere
Ecrire
Write


Appendix: VT100 Cursor
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If VT100 Fallback Mode, not the same as "+fallback" mode, is operating, the
following commands are used to manipulate the cursor:

Ctrl-A, Ctrl-W, Ctrl-S, Ctrl-D   (left, up, down, right)
Ctrl-Y, Ctrl-V                   (pageup, pagedown)

- Since Ctrl-S binds to "Save", in this case the "Save" command must be accessed
  by typing Ctrl-; and "S" (or "s")

- Likewise, Ctrl-Y binds to "Redo", so in this case "Redo" must be accessed by
  typing Ctrl-; and "Y" ; 

- Ctrl-V bound to "Paste" will be accessed by Ctrl-; and "V" (or "v")
